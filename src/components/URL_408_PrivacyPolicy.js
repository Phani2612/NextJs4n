        Hello Facebook Team,<br /><br />
        We hope this message finds you well!<br /><br />
        We are thrilled to integrate our application with Facebook and are excited about the possibilities this brings. We’ve set up our Privacy Policy page at the following URL: <a href="https://4necotech.in/privacy-policy">https://4necotech.in/privacy-policy</a>, where we detail how we handle user data.<br /><br />
        Rest assured, we're not hackers plotting world domination—we're just a team of enthusiastic developers eager to enhance our app with Facebook’s awesome features. We promise our intentions are as pure as our code!<br /><br />
        Thank you for reviewing our privacy policy and for your continued support. If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to reach out.<br /><br />
        Best regards,<br />
        The 4necotech Team
